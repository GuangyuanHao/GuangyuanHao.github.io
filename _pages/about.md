Hello! I am Guangyuan Hao. As a research assistant at Sun Yat-sen University, I am working with Prof. Weishi Zheng on exciting projects about machine learning and its applications. Recently, I am focusing on representation learning and GANs. In my spare time, I like cycling, playing table tennis and reading science fiction.
