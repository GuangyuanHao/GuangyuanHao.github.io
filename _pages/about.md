Hello! I am Guangyuan Hao. As a research assistant at Sun Yat-sen University, I am working with Prof. Weishi Zheng on exciting projects about machine learning and its applications. Recently, I focus on representation learning and GANs. In my spare time, I like cycling, playing Pingpong and reading science fiction.
